IPoo
====

IPoo is an application that should gather information from your
network from some keyword. Currently, it is able to do the following
tasks:
 - resolve DNS names (direct and reverse)
 - find which router is directly connected to an IP
 - grab information from some HTTP database
 - act as ipcalc

Those tasks can be extended using a simple plugin system.

IPoo is able to display those information using three interfaces:
 - a simple web interface
 - a Greasemonkey script
 - an XMPP client (jabber)

A sample configuration can be found in doc/ipoo.cfg.sample

Installation
------------

To user this application, you need the following Debian packages:
 - python-twisted-core (Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-twisted-names (Twisted Names - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-twisted-words (Twisted Words - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-nevow (Nevow - http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow)
 - python-netaddr (netaddr - https://github.com/drkjam/netaddr)
 - python-yaml (PyYAML - http://pyyaml.org/)

You need to write a "ipoo.cfg" that should be put in "/etc/ipoo".

You can install the application with:
 python setup.py build
 sudo python setup.py install

If you do not wish to install the application, you still need to
compile the module to build SNMP queries. This can be done with:
 python setup.py build_ext --inplace

You can launch the application by hand
 twistd -no ipoo
or
 twistd -no ipoo --config=/etc/ipoo/ipoo.cfg
